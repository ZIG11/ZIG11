### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Siggi! I'm currently an Electrical Engineering Masters student trying to learn Software Development, Systems Engineering, and more about software development concepts/tools. Some programming languages I know are C/C++ and am currently trying to learn more about Java and Python.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HW lol
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in learning more about ios development as I find it cool, as well as some advanced C++ topics
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about technology, photography, or car modifications
